# Word Embedding and Prediction using FastText Model

This project demonstrates the implementation of word embeddings and word prediction using the FastText model. FastText is a library for efficient learning of word representations and sentence classification, developed by Facebook Research.

## Features

- Word embedding generation using FastText
- Word similarity prediction
- Interactive word prediction based on context
- Support for multiple languages
- Easy-to-use Jupyter notebook interface

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages:
  - fasttext
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib (for visualizations)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yossefmohammed/Emedding_and_prediction_words-_FastText_Model.git
cd Emedding_and_prediction_words-_FastText_Model
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install fasttext numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Emedding and prediction words _FastText .ipynb"
```

2. Follow the notebook instructions to:
   - Load and preprocess your text data
   - Train the FastText model
   - Generate word embeddings
   - Make word predictions

## Project Structure

- `Emedding and prediction words _FastText .ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the implementation
- `Words1.pdf`: Sample word dataset for testing
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## How It Works

The project uses FastText's efficient word embedding algorithm to:
1. Convert words into dense vector representations
2. Learn semantic relationships between words
3. Predict similar words based on context
4. Generate word embeddings that capture morphological information
